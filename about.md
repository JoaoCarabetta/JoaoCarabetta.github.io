Hi! I am Jo√£o, as you may already know. I am a data scientist interested in transforming peoples lives with information. The path that I have taken involves government, academia, activism and social data. I hope to get good recipes from this blend.

Currently, I am a Researcher at the Centre of Technology and Society (CTS) at FGV and Applied Master student at the same institution. At the CTS, I work along 5 latin American cities to improve their data usage. Also, I try to comprehend the Brazilian Congress as an institution to propose better ways to legislate.

Outside academia, I expand my knowledge managing data projects for [Cognitivo.ai](https://www.cognitivo.ai) which is reinventing how companies put data on production.

I usually prefer to code in *get-it-running* language, which is often Python with SQL, Elastic Search, Docker at Google Cloud.
